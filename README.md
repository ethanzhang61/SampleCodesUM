HTML samples are in PersonMgmt.html, some are AngularJs embedded. 

C# samples are in Home.aspx.cs, JavaScript samples are in AdminHome.js, I listed all the codes for "Person Management" controller. I also finished "System Security setup" controller and partial "Report" controller, they are similar to the "Person Management" controller.

Also, I have more SQL samples in UpdateTimebreakdownEducation.sql, IDXMonthlyPullHours.sql and a stored procedure in spGetOutpatientClinicGrid.sql.
